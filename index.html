        <div class="about_speech">
            <p class="about_speech_p">It was 60 years back.... Seven visionaries ventured upon a mission named 'Jeevan
                Vikas'. Unmindful of success and fate, they were so obsessed with this cause that they virtually gave up
                their means of livelihood. When they sought government recognition for school, the chief patron and the
                former CM of Maharashtra, hon'ble Karmaveer Dadasaheb Kannamwar, with fatherly gesture said, "How will
                you survive, since none of you is from wealthy family? But appreciating their efforts he unhesitatingly
                granted govt. recognition to the school. Evoking tremendous response from the pupils and people it began
                with a bang, thanks to the iconic image and regards the founders achieved among the masses. Subsequently
                began the work of nation-building through a host of innovative curricular and co-curricular activities
                aimed at grooming ideal citizens for the nation. Complying with ideals the institute established a
                tradition of finding, a place in merit list of board exams and national level sports competitions.</p>
            <p class="about_speech_p">The institute felt honored when several rural pupils brought laurels in various
                fields and the name and fame of the alumni, crossed the boundaries of the nation. Still the bond of
                gratitude and affection between the alumni and the alma mater has not dwindled a bit over the years.
                Unlike other educational institutes discrimination against caste, creed, religion and sect failed to
                find a place in Jeevan Vikas' administration and management. Some founder members fought elections, they
                won or lost but they never yoked in teachers and employees for their political gains.</p>
            <p class="about_speech_p">Over the period of more than 60 years, education has undergone a drastic
                change. It is not the same what it was 60 years ago. Corruption reigns rampant in every walk of life and
                the field of education is no exception. Running an educational institute without flouting the ethics and
                ideals it has cherished, is truly not a child's play. In spite of all odds, we stand out as a unique
                institute imparting value based education in the region.</p>
            <p class="about_speech_p"> Keeping abreast of the changing time we intend to incorporate new courses for
                which we have to pool certain financial sources without violating our principles.

                have maintained a tradition of excellent results and premier position in sports, intellectual and
                cultural activities. ‘Jeevan Vikas’ thus stands out in the region for its quality education and
                distinctive character. The instt. has so far kept abreast of the changing time and I wish it will

                I feel honored being at the helm of Jeevan Vikas vidyalays which boasts of having more than 2300 pupils
                on its
                roll and about 100 teaching and non-teaching staff. I think that running an educational instt.
                without flouting the ethics and ideals is surely not a child's play. Over the period of Sixty years,
                education has undergone a drastic change. But in spite of all odds, we stand out as a unique instt.
                imparting value based education in the region. I am sure the instt will continue to scale the new
                heights of excellence in the days to come, for we believe that “Teaching is not talking or imparting
                doctrines but it is touching life forever."</div>

                The sapling planted in 1969 has grown far and wide under the able leadership of then headmaster Hon.
                Shree S.S.Ghate sir and supervisor Hon. Shree S. M. Zade sir. Since then we continue to scale the new
                horizons of progress with every passing year. I attrebute the creadit of this scucess to the innovative
                and efficient teaching staff and ever supportive management committee. I could keep up the tradition of
                best results thanks to the ever increasing trust shown by the parents at large. It was the glorious year
                for the school when in 2018-2019 it was selected for Atal Tinkering Lab under the auspices of Niti Ayog,
                Goverment of India. The pupils utilised it to embibe scientific attitude and the sense of being
                'Innovator'. I feel indedted to Jeevan Shikshan Mandal for their continued support and assistance. I
                extend my best wishes for the success of this institute.</div>

                Vocational Courses It gives students the opportunity to pursue vocational courses in the same amount of
                time, instead of doing traditional eleventh and twelfth course after the tenth, which significantly
                increases their job and self-employment chances. So if seen in this way, now students who have passed
                the tenth have got the option of HSCVC course in addition to plus two-course, ITI course, and diploma
                course. Another good thing about the HSCVC course is that in this, students get the option of many types
                of branches.

                much older game of Indian origin. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by

                half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders in 30 seconds. Points are scored for each
                player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. Players are
                taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled, but are brought back in for each point scored by
                their team from a tag or a tackle.

                Kitō-ryū jujutsu) due to an emphasis on "randori" (乱取り, lit. 'free sparring') instead of "kata"
